Hi! My name is Arya Prasetya. I am a Master student at TU Berlin, studying Scientific Computing. I have research interests in numerical linear algebra, optimization and quantum computing.

I am currently working as a student assistant in the Technical Acoustics department of TU Berlin, working with C++/Python implementations of state space systems.

For me,  **physics and math are my passion** â€”and coding is the tool that lets me keep doing them.
